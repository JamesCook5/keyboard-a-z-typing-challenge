This repository contains a python coding challenge that I did after my GCSEs. It allows you to store how quick you can enter the full alphabet down to 4 sig figs in seconds, where you are also able to see the personal best in the file. This code isnt perfect or even optomised, but it helped me learn how to use different libraries and functions in python, expanding my coding skills!
